# NYC Landlord Behavior Analysis Project

## Overview
This is an ongoing, semester-long data science project that explores landlord behavior in NYC using three primary datasets (additional datasets will be incorporated as research progresses):

- **Evictions dataset:** [Evictions data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Evictions/6z8x-wfk4/data)
- **311 complaints dataset:** [311 complaints data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9/about_data)
- **BBL dataset:** A unique identifier for NYC properties used to merge and cross-reference the datasets.

## Current objectives/groups of hypotheses
1. **Q1:** Analyze how property-related complaints and eviction rates correlate.
2. **Q2:** Identify landlords and patterns of landlord behavior based on building type, complaint frequency, and eviction trends.

## Project Structure
- **Cleaning notebooks** are separated from analysis notebooks to maintain clarity.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of eviction data is broken into 4 parts for readability and easier file management in Git.
