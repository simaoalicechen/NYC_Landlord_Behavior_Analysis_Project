# NYC Landlord Behavior Analysis Project

## This an ongoing, semester-long data science project explores landlord behavior in NYC using three primary datasets (will increase as research needs grow):

### Evictions dataset: Evictions data (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Evictions/6z8x-wfk4/data)
### 311 complaints dataset: 311 complaints data (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9/about_data)
### BBL

### Our current goal is to analyze how property-related complaints and eviction rates correlate, particularly focusing on identifying patterns of landlord behavior based on building type, complaint frequency, and eviction trends
